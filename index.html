    <p id="story">One day, when I was younger, I was reading a book in my bed before sleeping, it was a very good one & and a super big one for my age, it was called Eragon, I didn't see time pass and in the morning I was still reading it when my mom came to wake me up to go play my game of football... I was benched after like 10 minutes because I was horribly bad..</p>
    <span id="tldr">I was too deep into a book, didn't sleep, got benched.</span>
